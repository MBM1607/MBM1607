# Introduction
My name is Muhammad Khan. I am a Full-Stack developer and Mobile developer, currently studying for a Software Engineering degree from Virtual University.

I like programming because I am a natural problem solver. I prefer to program in Python with which I have four years of experience. I write concise and clean Pythonic code. I have a good understanding of functional and object oriented programming paradigms and use them extensively in my projects.

I am quite proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have a strong understanding of responsive and mobile-first web design principals. I have worked with React, Svelte, React Native and Meteor.js.

Iâ€™ve created a handful of web applications with Flask, FastApi, Django and Express.js.
However I am most familiar and experienced with Ruby on Rails framework with which I have two years of professional experience. 

I have adequate knowledge of relational databases and SQL. I am experienced with C++, Kotlin, and PHP, and have dabbled in game design using the Godot engine, Pygame, and Kivy. I have experimented with a myriad of frameworks and technologies.

I am a self-motivated developer blessed with a healthy amount of curiosity and ambition. I am rational and logical and love a challenge. I am dedicated and always willing to go the extra mile to make my mark on the programming world.

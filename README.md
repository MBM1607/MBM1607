# âœ¨ Hello, I am [Muhammad Khan](https://muhammadkhan.dev) âœ¨

I like programming because I am a natural problem solver.

I am most familiar and experienced with Ruby on Rails framework with which I have three years of professional experience.

Iâ€™ve created a handful of web applications with Flask, FastApi, Django and Express.js.

I have adequate knowledge of relational databases. I have worked extensively with both NoSQL and SQL databases.

I am a self-motivated developer blessed with a healthy amount of curiosity and ambition. I am rational and logical and love a challenge.

I am dedicated and always willing to go the extra mile to make my mark on the programming world.
